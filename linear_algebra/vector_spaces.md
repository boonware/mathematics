## Vector Spaces

### Dual Spaces
Every vector space $V$ over a field $\Kappa$ has an associated _dual space_ $V^*$. We define a _linear functional_ on $V$ as a map $\phi: V \to \Kappa $:

$$
    \phi(a \vec u + b \vec v ) = a \phi(\vec u) + b \phi(\vec v) \quad \text{where} \quad \vec u, \vec v \in V \quad a,b \in \Kappa
$$

These linear functionals are themselves vectors and form the dual space; they can be added and multiplied by scalars from $\Kappa$ to form new linear functionals:

$$
    \phi(\vec u) + \omega(\vec u) = (\phi + \omega)(\vec u)
$$
$$
    a \phi (\vec u) = (a \phi)(\vec u) 
$$
