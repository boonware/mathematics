## Hypothesis Testing
Suppose we have a hypothesis about a population and we wish to determine if it is true or false using statistics. The scenario where it false is called the _null hypothesis_ $H_0$, and where it is true is called the _alternative hypothesis_ $H_A$. Using a hypothesis test we determine if we should accept $H_0$ or reject it, thereby accepting $H_A$.

For example, consider the average height of adult men and women:

* $H_0$ - On average, men are not taller than women.
* $H_A$ - On average, men are taller than women.

### p-value
Of central importance to a hypothesis test is the _p-value_ ("p" for probability). This is the value that will be calculated to determine if either $H_0$ or $H_A$ should be accepted. The choice of test statistic depends on the kind of hypothesis being tested

### Performing a Test
The procedure for performing a hypothesis test is as follows:
1. Determine both $H_0$ and $H_A$.
2. Determine the _test statistic_. The choice depends on the kind of hypothesis being tested.
3. Calculate 

### Z-Score
The z-score or standard score tells by how many standard deviations a value differs from the mean. This is useful when comparing values from different populations, each having their own parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$, allowing the values to be compared in _standard units_.

$$
    z = \frac {{x} - \mu} {\sigma}
$$

The standard score follows the same distribution as the measured values $x$. 
68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the values lie within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean, respectively.

### Z-Test
To determine if a sample mean differsThe z-statistic is defined as follows:
$$
    z = \frac {\overline{x} - \mu} { \frac {\sigma} { \sqrt n } }
$$
