### Definition
The _normal distribution_ for a continuous random variable $x$ is defined as

$$ P(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}  e^{-\frac{1}{2}{(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}} $$

The center is given by the mean $\mu$, and the standard deviation $\sigma$ determines how "spread out" the graph is. It is also known as a Gaussian distribution, or bell curve due to its shape.
