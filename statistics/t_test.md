## Student's T-Test

### One-Sample Test
When performing a z-test the population standard deviation must be known. The point of a z-test is to test if the population's hypothesized mean is correct. It is unlikely that one would know the population standard deviation $\sigma$ but not know the population mean. To solve this problem we can use a **t-test**, where we instead use the _sample standard deviation_ $s$ as an estimate of $\sigma$:

$$
   t = \frac {\overline{x} - \mu_0} { s / \sqrt n  }
$$
